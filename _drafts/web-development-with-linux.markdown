I've been messing around with websites since before the advent of stylesheets.  I've always tried to keep up with the latest web trends and have always had little web projects of my own that I work on.  It wasn't until recently that I began developing in the Linux enviroment.

Up until the time I purchased my first iPhone (1st generation) I had been a PC boy.  The iphone changed things for me in a big way when it came to computers and design.  There is another way!!
