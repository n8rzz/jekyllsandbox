Wow!  Im am thuroughly impressed with Jekyll and how easy it is to put together.  It's incredible!  I come from a Wordpress background.  I've been toying around with Wordpress for the last 6 or seven years and, like most people, was my go to CMS for putting together a website.  

Over the years, however, as the system expanded it became very clunky.  It can do a lot and is extremely extendable but that comes at a cost, lots of code.  A lots of code.
